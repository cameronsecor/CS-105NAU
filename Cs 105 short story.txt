I agonized over whether I should pick 
“Rip Van Winkle” or “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” from Irving’s oeuvre. 
Both have many, many adaptations to their name 
and are so ubiquitous as to have drifted into the folklore realm. 
The latter certainly has more memorable recent adaptations, 
but the former is the only one with a bridge named after it. 
Ah, screw it, we’ll count them both.
